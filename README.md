- router: [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- component library: [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/) with some plugins
  - [material-ui-bottom-sheet](https://github.com/TeamWertarbyte/material-ui-bottom-sheet)

As for the styling work, the whole project are taking **CSS in JS** idea, take [aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite) as styling library.

Above all of this, we use a social media integrated tool named [hellojs](https://github.com/MrSwitch/hello.js).

And the utility function library we using [underscore](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore).

And the testing part, we are using [airbnb enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme), which is also the authority testing framework in React Community.



# Project Structure

The whole project consist with 5 parts: **container&redux, presenter, styles, utils and enzyme tests **.

- container&redux part

  This part mainly take the response of **actions, reducers & binding stuff**, this is the standard written about react-redux (contain redux-thunk) .

- presenter part

  This part's design according to [Dan Abramov's famous blog](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0), almost 90% components here are defined by pure ES6 functions, some of them using React Component classes due to using local *small-scope* state.

- styles part

  This part based on **aphrodite** library, so basically we create styles by pages and we also defined the default theme, which can be used by all the components styles.

- utils part

  This part is normal as any other porject's utils. However, this part contains all the social media dealing process like googleMap, Twitter, Linkedin etc.

- enzyme tests part

  This part is about testing react shadow rendering, dom rendering and test case, which based on **enzyme**.



# Q&A

1. Project shows `cannt find 'react'` after `yarn install`

   > running `yarn add global react` or `npm install -g react`
