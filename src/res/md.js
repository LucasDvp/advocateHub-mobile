    art1: '# Angular Style Guide\n\n## Versions\nThere are multiple versions of Angular, and thus there are multiple versions of the guide. Choose your guide appropriately.\n\n### Angular 1 Style Guide\n    [The Angular 1 Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1/README.md).\n\n### Angular 2 Style Guide\n    [The Angular 2 Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a2/README.md).\n\n## Angular Team Endorsed\nSpecial thanks to Igor Minar, lead on the Angular team, for reviewing, contributing feedback, and entrusting me to shepherd this guide.\n\n## Purpose\n*Opinionated Angular style guide for teams by [@john_papa](//twitter.com/john_papa)*\n\n    If you are looking for an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring Angular applications, then step right in. These styles are based on my development experience with [Angular](//angularjs.org), presentations, [Pluralsight training courses](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/john-papa) and working in teams.\n\n    The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building Angular applications by showing the conventions I use and, more importantly, why I choose them.\n\n>If you like this guide, check out my [Angular Patterns: Clean Code](http://jpapa.me/ngclean) course at Pluralsight which is a companion to this guide.\n\n                                                                         [![Angular Patterns: Clean Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/ng-clean-code-banner.png)](http://jpapa.me/ngclean)\n\n## Community Awesomeness and Credit\nNever work in a vacuum. I find that the Angular community is an incredible group who are passionate about sharing experiences. Many of my styles have been from the many pair programming sessions [Ward Bell](https://twitter.com/wardbell) and I have had. My most excellent friend Ward has helped influence the ultimate evolution of these guides.\n\n## Contributing\nOpen an issue first to discuss potential changes/additions. If you have questions with the guide, feel free to leave them as issues in the repository. If you find a typo, create a pull request. The idea is to keep the content up to date and use github’s native feature to help tell the story with issues and PR’s, which are all searchable via google. Why? Because odds are if you have a question, someone else does too! You can learn more here at about how to contribute.\n\n*By contributing to this repository you are agreeing to make your content available subject to the license of this repository.*\n\n### Process\n1. Discuss the changes in a GitHub issue.\n2. Open a Pull Request, reference the issue, and explain the change and why it adds value.\n3. The Pull Request will be evaluated and either merged or declined.\n\n## License\n\n_tldr; Use this guide.
